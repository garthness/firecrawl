    Lusha provides a RESTful API that allows you to query a comprehensive
    dataset of business profiles and company information.


    All API requests should be made over HTTPS (SSL), and the response bodies
    are delivered in JSON format.


    ## Data Source and Privacy

    Please note that **Lusha is a search platform**, meaning the data provided
    is not created or directly managed by us. Instead, it is retrieved from
    publicly available sources and through contributions from trusted business
    partners.


    For more information on how we collect, use, and handle business profiles,
    please refer to our [Privacy
    Policy](https://lusha.com/legal/privacy-notice/).


    ## Authentication

    To access the Lusha API, you must authenticate your requests using your API
    key. This key is unique to your account and is used to identify your usage
    of the API.


    ### How to Authenticate

    When making an API call, include your API key in the `api_key` header of the
    request.


    ### Important Notes

    - To obtain your API key, please visit the following link:
    https://dashboard.lusha.com/enrich/api

    - Your API key is sensitive and should be kept private. **Do not share it**
    with anyone outside of your organisation.

    - The API key is used to track and manage your usage of the API, so **ensure
    it is protected** from unauthorised access.


    ## Available Endpoints

    - **Person Enrichment**: Get contact information for individuals

    - **Company Enrichment**: Get detailed company information

    - **Prospecting**: Search and enrich contacts and companies based on
    specific criteria

    - **Account Management**: Monitor your API credit usage

    - **Signals**: Retrieve signals data for contacts and companies

    - **Recommendations**: Discover similar contacts and companies based on your
    existing data


    ## Rate Limiting

    Lusha API enforces rate limiting to ensure fair usage and protect against
    excessive load.


    - **General Rate Limit**: You can make up to 25 requests per second to each
    API endpoint

    - **Credit Usage API**: Has a specific rate limit of 5 requests per minute

    > **Note**: Rate limits may vary based on your account type and subscription
    plan. 
     If you're encountering rate limit issues frequently, please consult with your 
     account manager or Lusha support team to discuss your specific needs.


    ### Rate Limit Headers

    To monitor your current rate limit status, check the HTTP response headers
    in your API calls:


    | Header | Description |

    |--------|-------------|

    | `x-rate-limit-daily` | The total number of requests allowed per day under
    your current plan |

    | `x-daily-requests-left` | The number of requests remaining in your daily
    quota |

    | `x-daily-usage` | The number of requests you have made in the current
    daily period |

    | `x-rate-limit-hourly` | The total number of requests allowed per hour
    under your current plan |

    | `x-hourly-requests-left` | The number of requests remaining in your hourly
    quota |

    | `x-hourly-usage` | The number of requests you have made in the current
    hourly period |

    | `x-rate-limit-minute` | The total number of requests allowed per minute
    under your current plan |

    | `x-minute-requests-left` | The number of requests remaining in your
    current minute window |

    | `x-minute-usage` | The number of requests you have made in the current
    minute window |


    ### Notes on API Rate Limiting

    - If you exceed the rate limit, the API will return a 429 (Too Many
    Requests) error.

    - To ensure a smooth experience, respect the rate limits defined by your
    subscription tier.

    - Daily limits vary based on your billing plan — higher tiers have higher
    quotas.

    - You can programmatically track your usage through these response headers:
      - `X-RateLimit-Remaining-Daily`
      - `X-RateLimit-Reset-Daily`
    - It is strongly recommended to implement logic that:
      - Monitors these headers
      - Pauses or retries requests accordingly
      - Helps avoid hitting the limit and ensures reliable operation

    ## Error Codes

    Lusha API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the status of your
    request. These codes help you understand whether the request was successful
    or if there was an issue.


    | Status Code | Name | Description |

    |-------------|------|-------------|

    | **200** | OK | Successful request |

    | **400** | Bad Request | Badly formatted request |

    ### Error Response Format

    ```json

    {
      "error": {
        "code": 400,
        "message": "Invalid request parameters"
      }
    }

    ```


    ### Handling Errors

    - Always ensure your API key is correct and valid

    - Pay attention to the specific error message and code to troubleshoot
    issues efficiently

    - Implement proper error handling and retry logic in your application

    - For 5XX errors, implement exponential backoff before retrying

                    name: Amazon
                    description: >-
                      Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession
                      rather than competitor focus, passion for invention,
                      commitment to operational excellence, and long-term
                      thinking. We are driven by the excitement of building
                      technologies, inventing products, and providing services
                      that change lives. We embrace new ways of doing things,
                      make decisions quickly, and are not afraid to fail. We
                      have the scope and capabilities of a large company, and
                      the spirit and heart of a small one.


                      Together, Amazonians research and develop new technologies
                      from Amazon Web Services to Alexa on behalf of our
                      customers: shoppers, sellers, content creators, and
                      developers around the world.


                      Our mission is to be Earth's most customer-centric
                      company. Our actions, goals, projects, programs, and
                      inventions begin and end with the customer top of mind.


                      You'll also hear us say that at Amazon, it's always "Day
                      1." What do we mean? That our approach remains the same as
                      it was on Amazon's very first day - to make smart, fast
                      decisions, stay nimble, invent, and focus on delighting
                      our customers.

                      Lusha is the leader in Sales Streaming – a new sales
                      paradigm that streams top leads straight to salespeople
                      and handles all the outreach, so they can escape the lead
                      grind and just sell.


                      Lusha's Sales Streaming Platform is built around Sales
                      Playlists that continuously fill up with their ideal
                      prospects – think "Spotify for sales." With AI doing the
                      heavy lifting, Lusha uncovers great-fit leads salespeople
                      never knew existed and executes tailored, perfectly timed
                      cadences that get meetings booked. And the more you use
                      Lusha, the smarter it gets.


                      With Sales Streaming, salespeople spend most of their time
                      face-to-face with relevant prospects, driving 4-6X more
                      business.

                    Lusha is the leader in Sales Streaming – a new sales
                    paradigm that streams top leads straight to salespeople and
                    handles all the outreach, so they can escape the lead grind
                    and just sell.


                    Lusha's Sales Streaming Platform is built around Sales
                    Playlists that continuously fill up with their ideal
                    prospects – think "Spotify for sales." With AI doing the
                    heavy lifting, Lusha uncovers great-fit leads salespeople
                    never knew existed and executes tailored, perfectly timed
                    cadences that get meetings booked. And the more you use
                    Lusha, the smarter it gets.


                    With Sales Streaming, salespeople spend most of their time
                    face-to-face with relevant prospects, driving 4-6X more
                    business.
